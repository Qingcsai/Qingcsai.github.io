Research Experiences
======
* A Intelligent Classroom Attendance System Based on Dynamic Face Recognition, 2018.05–2019.05
  * Research Project of National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates(Completed)。 
  * This project uses face recognition algorithm based on deep learning to develop a real-time system for intelligent attendance in college classrooms from three aspects: face real-time detection and recognition algorithm, system interface construction, data acquisition and database operation. 
  * As the project leader, I was responsible for the implementation and optimization of face detection and recognition algorithm, the construction of the software operation interface and the management of the face database. 
* Four-rotor Aerial Mapping Intelligent Aircraft Based on Stm32f4, 2017.11–2018.12
  * Research Project of Hundred Step Climbing Program of South China University of Technology(Completed)。 
  * Based on stm32f4 controller, the project is developed from three aspects:stable flight control system, image segmentation algorithm and real-time data transmission system. It realizes four-rotor aerial mapping intelligent aircraft based on stm32f4. 
  * I was responsible for the construction of the four-rotor aerial, the optimization of the adaptive control algorithm and the image acquisition.
